# React PortfolioV2

Portfolio website built in React.

## Introduction
This website was built to showcase my technical skills, and web dev skills, while neatly showcasing my other projects. In many of my projects I used CSS frameworks such as bootstrap or tailwind. I decide to use CSS in scss format to display my understanding of CSS styling. I also limited my use of npm packages to keep the project simple and display my understanding of basic React principles. However, I did use react-hook-form to make use of the easy form validations, and react-intersection-observer to easily determine when an element is in view to add slide in animations. I also created a simple backend server, using NodeJS and Express to handle the contact form information.
